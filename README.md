# CCPRO Python Birds of a Feather group (ccpro-bof-python)

As I mentioned at this yearâ€™s CCPRO conference, the Executive Team of CCPRO is looking to increase networking and professional development opportunities for our members. This group will:

* Look at how to use Python;
* Learn Python best practices;
* Develop canned reports;
* Encourage networking opportunities; 
* Participate in multiple college projects;
* and Share report examples.

Simply stated, we will meet online, network, and share best practices focusing on the utilization of all things Python.
